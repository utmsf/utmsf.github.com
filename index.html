        <p>What is Refugee Camp 2011/Camp out for a Cause?</p>
        <p>43 million people worldwide live as refugees or internally displaced people (IDPs). For most people living in Canada it can be difficult to understand what the lives of displaced people are like, how the very things most of us take for granted - clean drinking water, shelter, and adequate food supply- can disappear in the blink of an eye. It can also be difficult to understand the scale of the world's refugee/IDP problem.
          <p>The University of Toronto's Friends of MSF hosts the annual &quot;Refugee Camp in the Heart of Campus&quot; to educate students of the lifestyle and conditions of refugees and internally displaced people. Every year we set up tents with educators to talk about the challenges these people face in regards to vaccination, water, sanitation, and nutrition. We also feature guest speakers from Doctor's WIthout Borders who share their personal experiences of what it has been like working under these conditions.   The event is followed by a &quot;Camp Out&quot; in which volunteers and U of T students are pledged to camp out with us to raise money for MSF Canada in support of refugees worldwide.</p>
