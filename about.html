<p><h2><a name="Mission">Mission</a></h2></p>

<p>Our group is the M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res University of Toronto Chapter, a student organisation fully affiliated with M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res / Doctors Without Borders Canada. Our mandate is to help students on campus respond to their concerns of humanitarian crises by helping them become aware of MSF and their work around the world.</p>

<p>MSF is the world's leading independent medical humanitarian organisation that delivers emergency aid to people affected by armed conflicts, epidemics, disasters, and exclusion from health care in close to 60 countries worldwide. Although students may not volunteer yet with MSF field missions, however, knowing that MSF needs engineers, accountants, nurses, journalists, and doctors can shape a student's career and life choices.</p>

<p>The objective of the MSF U of T Chapter will be to pursue the following goals as they pertain to the MSF mission and charter:
<br />(1) to draw attention to the value of international medical relief and humanitarian aid, specifically to the current field projects of MSF Canada;
<br />(2) to educate students about international health issues, such as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, while simultaneously striving to engage students and the public in the international response to such issues; and
<br />(3) to engage the student population in fundraising initiatives that support the work of MSF Canada.</p>

<p>These goals will be achieved with events that include guest speakers such as expatriates who have recently returned from the field, awareness campaigns that bring attention to MSF's current work and the issues they face like access to medicine, and fundraising activities which benefit MSF Canada.</p>

<p><h2><a name="History">History</a></h2></p>

<p>The University of Toronto Chapter for the Friends of MSF was founded in 2008 to provide an additional venue of expression for humanitarian enthusiasts on campus. Originally comprised of mostly medical students, the Chapter has since extended its reach with students from multiple faculties. With a strong affiliation with MSF Canada, our chapter has fostered a more active and aware environment on campus through several keynote events including the Refugee Camp Out for a Cause, Trauma Workshop and Treats for Treatment. The Friends of MSF University of Toronto Chapter has established a tradition of excellence in hosting events to engage the local community in the discourse of humanitarian aid.</p>

<p><h2><a name="Faqmsf">Frequently Asked Questions - About MSF</a></h2></p>

<p><h3><a href="javascript:unhide('whatis');">What is M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res/(MSF)?</a></h3>
<div id="whatis" class="hidden">
<br />MSF is an independent international medical organization that provides assistance to people caught up in crisis around the world. As well as providing medical care, MSF also "bears witness" to the plight of the people it assists when it thinks this can help those in crisis through talking to the authorities, to the UN, to key governments, by working with the press, and holding awareness events.</p>

</div>

<p><h3><a href="javascript:unhide('whereandwhen');">How do you decide where and when to go?</a></h3>
<div id="whereandwhen" class="hidden">
<br />MSF carries out independent assessments in a crisis to decide whether it is needed and whether it can assist. MSF works independently of any political, military, or religious agendas. This means that it can respond based on need alone. As a medical humanitarian organization, the primary criterion for intervention is always medical need.</p>

<p><h3><a href="javascript:unhide('mission');">What is MSF's mission?</a></h3>
<div id="mission" class="hidden">
<br />It is based on the principles of humanitarian action. That people caught in crisis deserve access to quality medical care and to be spared the excesses of violence. MSF has a charter that refers to providing assistance to all caught in crisis irrespective of who they are or where they live or what they believe in. This charter helps to define why we do what we do.</p>
