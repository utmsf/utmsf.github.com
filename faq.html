<p><h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1></p>
<p><h2>What is M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res/(MSF)?</h2></p>
<br />MSF is an independent international medical organization that provides assistance to people caught up in crisis around the world. As well as providing medical care, MSF also "bears witness" to the plight of the people it assists when it thinks this can help those in crisis through talking to the authorities, to the UN, to key governments, by working with the press, and holding awareness events.

<p><h2>How do you decide where and when to go?</h2></p>
<br />MSF carries out independent assessments in a crisis to decide whether it is needed and whether it can assist. MSF works independently of any political, military, or religious agendas. This means that it can respond based on need alone. As a medical humanitarian organization, the primary criterion for intervention is always medical need.

<p><h2>What is MSF's mission?</h2></p><br />
It is based on the principles of humanitarian action. That people caught in crisis deserve access to quality medical care and to be spared the excesses of violence. MSF has a charter that refers to providing assistance to all caught in crisis irrespective of who they are or where they live or what they believe in. This charter helps to define why we do what we do.

<p><h2>How many aid workers does MSF have?</h2><br />
At any one time there are about 24, 000 people in the field. Only 10% are international aid workers, the rest are hired locally.</p>

<p><h2>Does MSF recruit only doctors?</h2><br />
MSF recruits doctors, including anesthesiologists and surgeons, nurses, laboratory scientists, mental health professionals, midwives, and water-and-sanitation specialists. MSF recruits also recruits non-medical staff to work in its projects, as financial controllers, project coordinators, logisticians and other technicians. All of these people bring professional abilities, practical experience, as well as a commitment to and concern for the people they help.</p>

<p><h2>What are the recruiting criteria?</h2><br />
Two years professional experience and availability for a minimum of 9 months, except for surgeons and anesthesiologists that can be for as little as 4 weeks. Language skills, particularly French are considered a major asset as are relevant travel or work experience outside Canada. There are other qualifying factors, so refer to the website for details.</p>

<p><h2>Do field staffs have to pay for the expenses to support themselves in the field?</h2><br />
MSF provides small monthly remuneration to its field workers, and covers all expenses related to transportation, insurance, and room and board.</p>

<p><h2>How much of the money donated is actually spent on program activities?</h2><br />
More than 85% of the money donated goes to program activities - humanitarian assistance and raising awareness. The annual report is available online and in printed form.</p>

<p><h2>Are there any groups that you don't accept donations from?</h2><br />
Yes. MSF has guidelines about who it cannot accept donations from because their activities may directly contradict MSF's work. MSF does not take donations from arms, pharmaceutical, alcohol, or tobacco companies, for example. Refer to the MSF website for more info.</p>
