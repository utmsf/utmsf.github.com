It is only a few weeks away until the last day of classes and it is hard to believe how fast this school year has gone by.
The Friends of MSF UofT Chapter has had another fantastic year and it would not have been possible without the support of all our dedicated members. With that said, we are inviting all of you to apply for a position in our 2012-2013 Executive Committee. If you are passionate about advocating for global health and humanitarianism, joining our executive team would be a great opportunity for you to get involved, learn, and grow.</p>
